## About

A task management web application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **Sequelize**, and **Passport.js**.  
It allows users to register, log in, and manage their personal tasks through a clean, server-rendered interface using **Handlebars (hbs)** templates.  

The project is a refactor of an earlier version originally built with Express and Mongoose — rebuilt to learn and implement Sequelize ORM and Passport authentication.
